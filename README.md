# Face Mask Detection

Implementation of Face Mask Detection to restrict people without wearing a mask from entering inside any mall or airport etc. We have used Tensorflow, Keras and opencv to implement this.

# Requirements

* Python3
* Tensorflow 2.0
* Keras
* Numpy
* cv2
* Matplotlib

# Insatallation Instructions
```
$ pip install tensorflow(or any other package name)
```

# Results

# Improvement Scope
There is always a scope of improvement in any project. Few ways to improve this project are:
* Using "Temperature Sensor" to restrict people whose body temperature is above normal body temperature e.g 100.
* Use "Distance Measuring Sensors" to ensure social distancing.
If you think there can be more ways to improve this system please write to me(https://www.linkedin.com/in/1sh1vam/)
