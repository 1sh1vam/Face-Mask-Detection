# Face Mask Detection

Implementation of Face Mask Detection to restrict people without wearing a mask from entering inside any mall or airport etc. We have used Tensorflow, Keras and opencv to implement this.

# Requirements

* Python3
* Tensorflow 2.0
* Keras
* Numpy
* cv2
* Matplotlib

# Insatallation Instructions
```
$ pip install tensorflow(or any other package name)
```
